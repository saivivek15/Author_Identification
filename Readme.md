                               Stylometric Analysis of E-mail Content for Author Identification

The identification of the authorship of e-mail messages is of increasing importance due to an increase
in the use of e-mail for criminal purposes and publicizing of critical information through
anonymous e-mails which may lead to a catastrophe. An authors unique writing style can be
reduced to a pattern by making measurements of various stylometric features from the written
text. This project is developed to predict the author of an arbitrary e-mail by using customized writing style features.
An enhanced set of stylistic features including lexical, syntactic, content-specific, idiosyncratic
attributes and syntactic n-grams has been used to develop a cross-genre and cross-topic author
identification by the application of four classifiers which are Support Vector Machines, Gradient
Boosting, Random Forest and Voting classifier.
